        platform to reduce university student attrition rates.</h2>

        This project investigates the use of machine learning to help identify students that are encountering
        circumstances that may lead to them withdrawing from / dropping out of their university degree.
        The philosophy of this site stems from the belief that people can feel powerless when dealing with situations
        that appear overwhelming and inevitable. This site is designed to provide information that can re-empower
        individuals and help them in becoming an active participant in finding alternative solutions to dropping out.

        This project is part of an Masters project for the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Conversion MSc at
        Queen Mary University of London, any issues or concerns regarding the project should be addressed to either the
        author or the project supervisor.
